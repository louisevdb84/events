The website will need to have a sample video embedded 
into it somewhere as well for a placeholder for a 
future video.

It just needs to be a simple, blog-like page where 
people can stay up-to-date on local events and 
sign up for those events if they wish to join/join 
a mailing list. 

Memphis themes on the website (Elvis Presley,
 Martin Luther King Jr, Justin Timberlake, Lecrae, 
 etc. People from Memphis, TN, USA basically.)

They also want people to be able 
 to sign up for separate events within the website. 
 They want the site to be a site where people can go 
 to see updates on recent events and sign up for 
 those events, basically. They don't care what it 
 looks like, they just want it to look good and 
 potentially have a Memphis, TN theme

 From my understanding, there shouldn't be any 
 backend code here. Just simply relying on mailchimp 
 to provide signup functionality for events
I also think they haven't decided about the mailchimp 
accounts situation, and are looking for just a page
 that works and is functional with a dummy mailchimp 
 account for now

 @Arshi , the events will be pretty diverse but 
 mostly music festival/food festival type events.
  In Memphis, everyone loves music and barbeque so 
  they intend to have events surrounding those 
  things. They will have information sessions 
  surrounding the work they do as well, and I'm 
  sure they will have other events thrown in there 
  too.(edited)

 Also, someone asked earlier about React and whether 
 or not the client is comfortable with it. The client 
 organization uses React frequently so you all should 
 feel free to use it if you want.
