It is a completely different page where local events 
will be advertised and people will be able to sign up 
for those events (Through mailchimp). 

The website will need to have a sample video embedded 
into it somewhere as well for a placeholder for a 
future video.

It just needs to be a simple, blog-like page where 
people can stay up-to-date on local events and 
sign up for those events if they wish to join/join 
a mailing list. 

The website should have a Memphis, TN theme (where 
the company is located). Memphis is a city in 
Tennessee, USA. The events will be in Memphis, 
Tennessee, USA so it might be a good idea for you 
to have Memphis themes on the website (Elvis Presley,
 Martin Luther King Jr, Justin Timberlake, Lecrae, 
 etc. People from Memphis, TN, USA basically.)

 Andrei was right about there being no restrictions 
 on how you do this project. The client wants a 
 website that is totally separate from the 
 original website. They also want people to be able 
 to sign up for separate events within the website. 
 They want the site to be a site where people can go 
 to see updates on recent events and sign up for 
 those events, basically. They don't care what it 
 looks like, they just want it to look good and 
 potentially have a Memphis, TN theme
